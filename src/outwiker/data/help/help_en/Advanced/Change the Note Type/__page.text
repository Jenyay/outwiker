It is not possible to change note type via GUI. However, it can be done manually, since any note is stored on disk as set of text and bitmap files.

In order to manualy change the note type do the following:

# Run Windows Explorer, go to the directory where the note's files are located.
# Open the ''__page.opt'' file in a text editor.
# Change value of the ''Type'' field of the ''[General]'' section with the desired type name and save the file.
# Launch OutWiker (if OutWiker's window has already been opened, go to "Tools / Reload Wiki" to refresh the tree of notes).

At the moment OutWiker supports the following note types:
* text - [[Text Page -> page://__b32aa743-384d-493f-aad4-4c4cbf945fbb]];
* html - [[HTML Page -> page://__0cc8f2c6-754c-4aa8-b118-561b930e9955]]; 
* wiki - [[Wiki Page -> page://__dd8b23a1-6787-42bb-9b58-c78a656688e2]];
* search - [[Search Page -> page://__80ff0cd2-f4f3-42d8-9b38-4a73cf42a9d0]].

'''Use the described procedure with caution for the syntax as well as structure of ''__page.opt'' and ''__page.text'' files depend on the note type.'''
