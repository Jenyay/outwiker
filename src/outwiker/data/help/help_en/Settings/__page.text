!!! [[#ini]] Settings File Location

OutWiker keeps all settings in the ''outwiker.ini'' file. Its location depends on the operating system and running mode (portable or normal).

In portable mode the ''outwiker.ini'' file located in the same directory as the executable file ''outwiker.exe''. The same is true for plug-ins, icons and note styles. It means OutWiker can be copied and run, for example, from a memory stick. It allows to run the program securely, compare to normal mode.

If OutWiker runs in the normal mode, under '''Windows 7/10''' the ''outwiker.ini'' file is normally placed at the user's profile directory, namely, ''C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\outwiker'' . Also, this directory houses special subdirectories for plug-ins, styles and icons.

The location of the settings file Under '''Linux''' depends on the value of ''XDG_CONFIG_HOME'' environment variable. If the environment variable is not set the ''outwiker.ini'' file locates in the ''~/.config/outwiker'' directory.

All the preferences described below can be changed in the "Preferences" dialog, which can be called via the '''Edit - Preferences...''' menu.
