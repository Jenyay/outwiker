!!! Plugins

%center%Attach:outwiker_opt_plugins.png

The list of the installed [[plugins -> page://__d19b4552-2b5e-4aa2-b7c7-8843d5de319b]] can be found in this section. If a plug-in is selected then information pane appears to the right of the list. It contains the following info: plug-in name, version number, short description and link to the plug-in webpage (if exists).

Deselecting check-box against a plug-in allows to disable it (note that the plug-in is not removed!) to have cleaner interface by hiding plugins button bar as well as menu temporarily.
