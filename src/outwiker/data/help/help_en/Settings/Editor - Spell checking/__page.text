%center%Attach:outwiker_opt_editor_spell.png

In the "Spell checking" section one can select dictionaries for spell checking.

The spell checking dictionaries are located in the ''spell'' subdirectory of the program's directory as well as the ''spell'' directory of the settings directory (in case of Windows 7 and above, it is ''C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\outwiker\spell''; in case of Linux, it is ''~/.config/outwiker/spell'' by default).

It is possible to set custom dictionary which contains words added by user.
