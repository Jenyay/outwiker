!!! Adding tags to notes

Tags can be used to find specific note(s). Any number of tags can be associated with a note.

There are several ways to add tags to notes. Sometimes it is convenient to add tags when creating a note. There is special field "Tags" on the "Create page" dialogue. A few new tags can be entered this way, tags should be separated with commas.

To make it easier to enter existing tags, one can use the tag cloud located below the "Tags" field. When one clicks on the tag, it is appears in the input field. The menu "Tree/Page Properties..." can be used to add tags to the existing pages (it calls the dialogue "Edit page properties...").

Alternatively, tags can be added using the "Tags" pane of the main window (if the pane is hidden, it can be opened using the menu "View/Tags").

To associate tag listed on the pane one needs to middle-click the tag. If the tag has already been associated with the note (those tags are highlighted with yellow colour) middle-clicking has the opposite effect, i. e. it removes (un-associates) the tag from the note.

Tags associated with greater number of notes (more popular tags) appear in larger font size on the "Tags" pane. The lesser used tags appear smaller.

Left-clicking on a tag results in popping up a list of pages which the tag is associated with.
