Plug-ins for Outwiker can be found at [[here -> http://jenyay.net/Outwiker/Plugins]].

In order to install a plug-in one needs to download the archive with plug-in's files and unpack it to the ''plugins'' subdirectory located in the same directory as "Outwiker.exe" (for portable version) or to the ''outwiker\plugins'' subdirectory of the user's settings directory (it is {+C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\outwiker\plugins+} under Windows 7/8/8.1 and {+/home/USERNAME/.config/outwiker/plugins+} under Linux). The easiest way to open the plug-in folder is to use "Help / Open Plugins Folder" menu.

To post a plug-in written by third party on the OutWiker's webstite, please, submit it to [[mailto: jenyay.ilin @ gmail.com | jenyay.ilin @ gmail.com]] with detailed description.
